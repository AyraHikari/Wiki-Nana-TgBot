# Getting update

Assistant will check update every bot is running, make sure you're on official branch.

> To check update manual, just type `update` with Command (default is .) in your nana bot.
> To get update, type `update now` in your nana bot.

Or you can update via Assistant (If they notify you), just click Update Now and wait for update!
